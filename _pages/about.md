Introduction 
------
I am currently pursuing PhD in the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/decision-intelligence/home) at the department of AI in Korea University. My advisor is [Changhee Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kSvJTg4AAAAJ&hl=en), under whose passionate teaching and guidance, I am diligently working on my doctoral degree.
